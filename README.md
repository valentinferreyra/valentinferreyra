### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is my personal Github profile. In this page I upload projects carried out in the university, and I also upload small projects and exercises carried out in programming courses of my own interest.

I currently work as a Backend Developer using Golang; but I aspire to become a solid Fullstack Developer, and for that I use this github as a learning source.
